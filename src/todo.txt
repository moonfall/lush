big questions:
	what sort of gain range is necessary?
	what level should gain occur to?
	is floating point necessary?

convert over existing patterns
fft window
disable audio gathering when not necessary
free-running/interrupt based adc
	determine sample frequency
	how many bits?
	how many reads to average?
decide on sample type of audio data - q15, q31, f15
	determines output of fft
add peak detection
proper fft sound analysis
	convert into N bins (constant Q?)

	interpolation ballistic
	display modes of spectre, ispectrum, bluecat
three sets of pixel data
	high level description?
	>24 bit source (being dithered)
	24 bit being drawn
	24 bit being scanned out
better gain adjustment
	automatic gain adjustment
better adjustment of min/max db
better defaults of min/max db
user interface to control patterns being displayed
user interface to configure system
user input to actual patterns
allow values to be logged when changed
eeprom storing of settings
save/restore of settings via serial
